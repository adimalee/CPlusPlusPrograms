This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 16:  
  vector object, sequential search
  
1.  Create a program that uses the Sequential Search Algorithm to search a STRING VECTOR OBJECT.

    You may begin with the Sequential search algorithm in the text page 1016, on slide 5 of the powerpoint
    lecture or implement in your own way
    
a.  Write the sequential search function using a vector.

b.  Create a vector object and request a list of names from the user, first names are adequate.  
    Store the names in a string vector.
    
c.  Request a sentinel value to end the input sequence.

d.  Request a search name from the user.  Remember, unless you account for case, the data will be case sensitive.

e.  Call the sequential search function.

f.  Upon return from the search, display an appropriate message indicating whether the name was 
    or was not found.

You may download and use the 'primer' .cpp file which should get you started using the sequential 
search prototype defined.  You DO NOT have to use this.

Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

If you like to include the following line of code:  system("pause");
You MAY need to:  #include <cstdlib>

The program may be named any name of our choice, must 
have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

Create with Dev-C++.  Compile and run.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp). All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to get credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

MUST be submitted before end of class.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
