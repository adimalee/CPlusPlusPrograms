This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 12:  
  virtual functions (think about compile-time and run-time binding)
  
1.  The attached program outputs the following:

The car is a Ford
========================
The car is a Ford
========================
This car is a Sedan
========================
The car is a Ford
========================
The car is a Ford
========================


2.  Using methods learned in class, modify the program so it outputs the following:

The car is a Ford
========================
The car is a Ford
========================
This car is a Sedan
========================
The car is a Ford
========================
The car is a Ford
========================
This car is a Sedan
========================

   

Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

If you like to include the following line of code:  system("pause");
You MAY need to:  #include <cstdlib>

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

Create with Dev-C++.  Compile and run.

SUBMIT the code ( *.h and *.cpp) files and the project file (*.dev).   All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to receive credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

MUST be submitted before end of class.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
