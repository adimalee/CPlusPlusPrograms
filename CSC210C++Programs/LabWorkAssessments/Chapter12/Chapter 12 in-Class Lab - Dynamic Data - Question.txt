This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 12:  
  dynamic data, arrays, pointer addresses
  
1.  Create a structure called students.  The structure should contain: 

    firstname, lastname, gpa.

2.  Create a pointer to the student structure and dynamically create an array of the 
    student structure, enough for 4 students.
  
    Hint:  Store the address of the beginning of the array 
    
3.  Create a file that contains four rows of data with last name, first name and gpa value 
    or use the inFile.txt file attached.

4.  Using pointer notation only (not array notation []), read the data from the file and 
    store the data into the structure.
    
    After all the data is read and stored, using pointer notation only, output to the console (cout) 
    each  student's first name, last name and gpa.  Use information messages and ensure the data
    is displayed properly.
    
5.  Before exiting, delete the dynamically allocated structure array.

Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

If you like to include the following line of code:  system("pause");
You MAY need to:  #include <cstdlib>

The program may be named any name of our choice, must 
have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

Create with Dev-C++.  Compile and run.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp). All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to get credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

MUST be submitted before end of class.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
