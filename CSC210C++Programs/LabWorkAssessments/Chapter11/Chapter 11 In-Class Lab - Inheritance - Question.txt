This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 11:  
  classes, inheritance
  
1. Design the class doctorType, inherited from the class personType 
   defined in the book or the code provided in Programming Examples, with an 
   additional data member to store a doctor's speciality.
   
2. Add appropriate constructors and member functions to initialize,
   access, and manipulate the data members.
   
3. Code a test program that creates an object, setting the data properly and prints
   all the the data in the object (first name, last name, speciality).
  
Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

If you like to include the following line of code:  system("pause");
You MAY need to:  #include <cstdlib>

The program may be named any name of our choice, must 
have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

Create with Dev-C++.  Compile and run.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp, *.h) and your project file (for Dev C++  is *.dev). All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to get credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

MUST be submitted before end of class.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
