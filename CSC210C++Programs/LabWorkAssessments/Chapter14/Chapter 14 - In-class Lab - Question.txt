Chapter 14 - In-Class Lab

This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 14:  
  exception handling
  
1.  Create a program that uses EXCEPTION HANDLING to deal with an invalid input file entry
    by a user.
    
    a.  Create a file, name of your choice, that contains one line of data for input.
    
    b.  Request the file name from the user.
    
    c.  Open the file.
    
    d.  If the file does not open, throw an exception.
    
    e.  Catch the exception and output a message to the user.
    
    f.  Loop until the user enters a proper file name.
    
    g.  If the file DOES open, read and output (cout) the line of input and exit the program.
    
    h.  TEST the program by FIRST entering a bogus file name, THEN entering the correct file name.
   
    
    
Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

If you like to include the following line of code:  system("pause");
You MAY need to:  #include <cstdlib>

The program may be named any name of our choice, must 
have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

Create with Dev-C++.  Compile and run.

SUBMIT the code (*.cpp) files .   All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to receive credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

MUST be submitted before end of class (9:30)

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
