This lab will exercise your understanding of some of the concepts covered in Chapter 13:  
  overloading operators
  
1.  Using the solution for the class Pet (Chapter 10):

    a.  Create a new private member variable to represent the number of pets.
    
    b.  Include the new variable in the default constructor for initialization (if appropriate),
        set, get, print and other functions as appropriate
        
    c.  Overload the + (plus) operator as follows:
    
        petobject + amount -- will increase the number of pets by the amount
        
    d.  In the test program, create a pet object with 1 in the number of pets,
        add an amount to the pet object, and print the object
    
    
    
Complete as much as you can before you leave ensuring what you've completed compiles.  These labs are 
entirely for your practice.

If you like to include the following line of code:  system("pause");
You MAY need to:  #include <cstdlib>

The program may be named any name of our choice, must 
have a .cpp extention; variables may be any name of your choice.

You DO NOT have to comment these programs, however, please include your NAME as a comment in ALL code files.

Create with Dev-C++.  Compile and run.

SUBMIT the code ( *.h and *.cpp) files and the project file (*.dev).   All files must be submitted and the program MUST compile and run to receive credit.

You MAY zip the files and submit the zipped files.

MUST be submitted before end of class.

Questions will be entertained; solution will be discussed in class. This is a collaborative effort to provide examples
and practice for your understanding.
